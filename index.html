					Like you said 2017 has been a rough year for us. Our relationship has always had it's ups and downs, but this past year was really our toughest one yet. I know I don't always show it or let you know, but our relationship is the most important thing in the world to me. You've been my best friend for 3 years now and I couldn't ask for a better one. I mean honestly nobody has and ever will make me feel as: 
					<ul class = "text">
						<li type = "circle">happy</li>
						<li type = "circle">mad</li>
						<li type = "circle">crazy</li>
						<li type = "circle">downright giddy</li>
					</ul>
					<span class = "text">as you have.</span>
				</p>
				<p class= "text">The thing is I love every bit of that. From the moments we spend out in Vegas, Europe, LA, etc., to the ones we spend watching our favorite shows, or even just laying down sleeping with each other, I do cherish every one of them together. I am excited for the time we will be spending together in 2018!
